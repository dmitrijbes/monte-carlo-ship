# Monte Carlo Ship
Example of Monte Carlo method usage to get probability of ship traversing minefield.

## Task
There is a matrix filled with water. There are mines in some random places.  
Ship must move from left down corner (start point) to right up corner (end point).  
Ship can move only up and right with 1/2 probability for each direction.  
When ship moves to cell with mine - it is destroyed.  
Use Monte Carlo method to get probability of ship successfully reaching end point.  

## How to Run
1\. Run Makefile to compile "main.exe".  
2\. Run "main.exe" to.. well.. run.
